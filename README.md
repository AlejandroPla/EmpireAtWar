# IdeaDelJuego-Empire At War-
Empire at War is a game of strategy by turns and resource managament based on the indie game Antiyoy. In it you take control of one of two factions with the objective of taking your empire to victory.

Empire at War is played by turns between two players. Each player moves their units to spaces next to the ones they own (marked with a dinstinct color) to conquer territory and increase their incomes. Both players star with a principal base that they must defend at all costs, and it will mean defeat if the enemy destroys it. The players can build farms (for more resources) and towers (to protect the territory next to it). The resources can be used to build new units to attack the enemy and conquer territories. They will have diverse units to choose, some stronger than others but also more expensive to recruit and keep. When starting the game, all players start with a couple of barns, a tower and some pawns. They will have to use this resources to survive and expand in the next early turns. Other than resources, units requiere incomes to keep them alive. If the incomes aren't enough to mantain a player's units, they will die in the next turn. The winner is the first player to conquer the map or destroys the enemy base.
