    <p><font color = silver><strong>Empire at War</strong> is a turn-based strategy and resources management game inspired in the indie game of the same genre <a href = 
      "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yio.tro.antiyoy.android&hl=es"> Antiyoy, made by Yiotro</a>. <br>In it, you take control of a king that
       must face his enemies and expand his kingdom and riches. Use your knights, peasants and spearmen and your military might to become the greatest<br> 
       empire on Earth.</font></p>

    <p><font color = silver><h4>Instructions</h4></p>
    <p>The map of Empire at War is divided in blocks. Each player starts in one side of the map with a few blocks next to their base.</p>
    <p>Each turn the player creates new units and buildings, or move existing units to new blocks. The player to control most of the map and/or destroy <br>
    the enemy player's base wins the game</p>
    <p>Creating new buildings and units requires gold. You make gold with farms and your base, but if you lose all your gold in one turn, your units will abandon you. Beware!</p>
    <p>Every building and unit has different values and stats, and serve their porpose with different strategies. Ligth units like the peasant and spearman are cheap and <br>
    quick to take unclaimed land. Swordmen and horsemen are heavy, expensive units that can take down fortified buildings.</p>
    <p>Buildings have a vital part in the game: they defend claimed blocks and provide income to the kingdom. Farms and the player's base provide gold after each turn, and towers<br>
    and fortresses defend the blocks adyacent to the building. Each has different life that allows them to survive attacks from enemy units.</font></p>
